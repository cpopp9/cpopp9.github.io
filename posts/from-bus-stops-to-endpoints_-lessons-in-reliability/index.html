Endpoint Lessons from a Tiny Gadget To be fair, this is just a fun side project for me—it works fine right now, and it’s not worth engineering all the edge cases. But in the enterprise, these fallback methods are critical. Here’s how they’d translate:\nCommunication: The most important thing for user-facing endpoints is clarity. If something fails, explain in plain language what happened, what the system is doing to fix it, and what the user should do next if it can’t self-heal. (In my project, the device could display an error message instead of going blank.)\nRetries: Don’t fail once and give up. Endpoints should retry automatically, often with backoff timers. Many transient issues resolve on their own. (My ESP32 could simply retry fetching bus data if the API timed out, without needing me to reboot it.)\nRedundancy: Have a backup plan. This could mean falling back to cached data, using a secondary network, or offering reduced functionality until full service is restored.\nMonitoring: Keep an eye out for issues. Create a dashboard where I can see all of my IoT devices in one spot with their status’. This would make it easier to spot trends, preemptively solve problems that weren’t anticipated, and administer fixes before they create roadblocks for users.\nFallback: Give users alternative ways to get what they need. If the device can’t fetch data, it could at least display “Check SEPTA app” instead of showing nothing, or give directions on where to find a paper copy of the schedule.\nThe Bigger Picture In a perfect world, uptime is 100% and nothing breaks. But reality is messy and even the best-designed systems eventually fail.\nWhether it’s a tiny IoT gadget on my desk or a fleet of thousands of enterprise laptops, failing to plan for failure is planning to fail.\n",

<p>Fast forward to today: I discovered the <strong>ESP32</strong>, a low-cost Wi-Fi/Bluetooth-enabled SoC that’s perfect for small connected projects. Even better, <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/5483?srsltid=AfmBOorYDFw9EUAeD_GyuVeTUep5FaZ0WtxKgpp2a5_u7v662tagN21O">Adafruit’s version</a> includes a built-in LCD display.

<p>With this little board, I wrote a lightweight program that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pulls data from a web API (<a href="https://www3.septa.org/">via SEPTA Developer program</a>)</li>
