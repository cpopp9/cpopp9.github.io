      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve wanted to really understand Microsoft’s cloud stack for a while, but reading docs and watching tutorials only gets you so far. Things are always shifting: product name changes, services getting folded into one another, best practices evolve. Before long, everything you just learned is out of date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to stop reading about it and start doing. I’m building this homelab as my sandbox where I can try, break, rebuild, and finally, understand what works (and why).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
